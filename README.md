For my final project in numerical methods, I chose to address a common daily-life issue by combining numerical methods to create a simple app. The project is designed to help users automate decisions about what to eat while balancing their nutrition.
all the data is created by ChatGPT
Here's how the app works:

User Input: Users input their physical data and health habits into the app.
Nutritional Calculation: The app calculates the daily nutritional needs based on the input data.
Food Recommendations: Based on the calculated nutritional needs and the user's food preferences, the app generates food recommendations.
Restaurant Search: The app uses the Google Maps API to find restaurants near the user's location that offer the recommended foods.

You can watch a demonstration video of the app on my YouTube channel.
